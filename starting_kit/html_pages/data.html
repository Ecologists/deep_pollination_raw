<p> Go to the <b>FILES</b> tab to download the data and the starting kit. The starting kit contains a very small subset of the data in the folder sample_data for debug purposes. To prepare a challenge submission, you need to use the large dataset that you will download separately.
For the the large dataset, you do NOT have the labels!
