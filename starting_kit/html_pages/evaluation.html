<h1>Evaluation</h1>

<p>
The problem is a multiclass classification problem. Each sample (an Image) is characterized by its feature extracted from opencv KAZE description (100 features). You must predict the Insect categories: bee, wasp, butterfly, other insect or other non-insect.
</p>


<p>
You are given for training a data matrix X_train of dimension num_training_samples x num_features 
and an array y_train of labels of dimension num_training_samples. You must train a model
which predicts the labels for two test matrices X_valid and X_test. 
</p>



<p>
<h3>Note:</h3>
You are allowed to use features extracted from other images from other sources or use pre-trained neural networks.
</p>



<p>
<h3>Phases:</h3>
There are 2 phases:
<ul>
<li> <b>Phase 1: development phase. </b> We provide you with labeled training data and unlabeled validation and test data.
Make predictions for both datasets. However, you will receive feed-back on your performance on the validation set only. 
The performance of your LAST submission will be displayed on the leaderboard.
<li> <b>Phase 2: final phase.</b> You do not need to do anything. Your last submission of phase 1 will be automatically forwarded.
Your performance on the test set will appear on the leaderboard when the organizers finish checking the submissions. 
</ul>
</p>



<p>
<h3>Submissions:</h3>
This competition allows you to submit either:
<ul>
<li> Only prediction results (no code).
<li> A pre-trained prediction model. 
<li> A prediction model that must be trained and tested. 
</ul>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Metric Of Evaluation:</h3>
The submissions are evaluated using the <b>accuracy</b> metric.<br>
