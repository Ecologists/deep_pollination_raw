description = The data is property of MUSÉUM NATIONAL D’HISTOIRE NATURELLE. The data consists of 290,000 images including images of bees, wasps, butterflies and other insects.
preparation = The data was processed to get uniform images of resolution 128x128. After preprocessing the data was divided into Train, Validation and Test sets. 
representation = OpenCv features extracted by the opencv algorithm from the image which represents different image properties
